blurb:
    heading: Welcome
    text: "Welcome to the future home of the Railroad Performance Measures 2.0 website, where five major North American freight railroads will be voluntarily reporting three weekly performance measures — Cars On Line, Train Speed, and Terminal Dwell. Since 1999, the railroads have been making this data available in a commitment to improve communications with their customers."
intro:
    heading: "Trends"
    text: "All five railroads use the same definitions to calculate their performance data, ensuring a high degree of consistency of the measurements. However, these measures are most useful for examining trends and relative changes, and least useful as absolutes."

#     text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
