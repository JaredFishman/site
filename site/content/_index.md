subtitle: Railroad Performance Measures 2.0

blurb:
    heading: Welcome
    text: "Welcome to the future home of the Railroad Performance Measures 2.0 website, where five major North American freight railroads will be voluntarily reporting three weekly performance measures â€” Cars On Line, Train Speed, and Terminal Dwell. Since 1999, the railroads have been making this data available in a commitment to improve communications with their customers."
intro:
    heading: "Trends"
    text: "All five railroads use the same definitions to calculate their performance data, ensuring a high degree of consistency of the measurements. However, these measures are most useful for examining trends and relative changes, and least useful as absolutes."
