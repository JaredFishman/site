    Terminal Dwell is the average time a car resides at the specified terminal location expressed in hours.
    The measurement begins with a customer release, received interchange, or train arrival event
    and ends with a customer placement (actual or constructive), delivered or offered in interchange, or train departure event.
    Cars that move through a terminal on a run-through train are excluded, as are stored, bad ordered, and maintenance of way cars.
